# Logging Sample Codes

We will explore Literal.ai, LangSmith, and TruLens.

## Literal.ai

### Install Required Packages

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate your virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Sample Script

Run the sample script:

```bash
python literalai-sample.py

### Important Note

This script includes a basic implementation of uploading the GPT interaction to Literal.ai. If you use the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) function, you need to fix the `ai_assistant` function accordingly.
